# mat.cpp
## A matrix library written in c++ for educational purposes

## Todo

### Basic Operations:
- [x] Implement matrix creation (e.g., from an array or zeros)
- [x] Implement matrix printing (output in a readable format)
- [x] Implement matrix addition (element-wise)
- [x] Implement matrix subtraction (element-wise)
- [ ] Implement matrix scalar multiplication (multiply each element by a constant)
- [ ] Implement matrix scalar division (divide each element by a constant)
- [ ] Implement matrix transposition (swap rows and columns)
- [ ] Implement matrix equality check (compare if two matrices are equal)
- [ ] Implement matrix resizing (expand or shrink the matrix)
- [ ] Implement matrix determinant calculation (for small square matrices, e.g., 2x2 and 3x3)

### Intermediate Operations:
- [ ] Implement matrix multiplication (standard matrix product)
- [ ] Implement matrix inversion (for invertible square matrices)
- [ ] Implement matrix rank (using Gaussian elimination or similar techniques)
- [ ] Implement matrix trace (sum of diagonal elements)
- [ ] Implement matrix diagonalization (for certain square matrices)
- [ ] Implement matrix identity creation (returning an identity matrix of size n)
- [ ] Implement matrix row and column operations (e.g., swapping rows/columns, scaling rows/columns)
